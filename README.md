# CHICAGO CRIME DATA VISUALIZATION | R
This group project was inspired out of a curiosity for assessing crime rates throughout Chicago’s various different neighborhoods. Using Tableau, R statistical analysis, and the 2012 – 2016 crime data from Kaggle, my team and I investigated the different types of crimes that occurred, the arrest rates, and the frequency and time of year they took place. This investigation covered 3 different techniques for analyzing the crime dataset: exploratory graphs (dot and bar charts and treemaps), time series (line plots and heat maps), and geographical graphs.
